# PhoniPedia-UIKit

My Very First iOS App Ever
Written in Swift and Using UIKit Framework

With this app you can access a rich database of smartphones and digital devices with the help of the API made by @azharimm (https://github.com/azharimm/phone-specs-api.git).
You can search for specific devices by their name, browse devices categorized by their brands or using three pre-defined filters: “Top by Interest”, “Top by Fans” and “Latest”.
With each device you’re provided with one or more images as well as a full list of features and specifications.
You can also add and delete devices to Favorites section which is stored locally, and can be accessed as long as you have the app on your iPhone.
